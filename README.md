# IMDB-2024-Data-Scraping-and-Visualizations

The main objective of this project is to build a model to extract and analyse movie data for a particular year. The model has to effectively scrape down preferences from a webpage to be organised in the desired database for further analysis and visualisations. Adding along an attractive user interface for users to query and explore the dataset.
